1)An Oracle VIEW, in essence, is a virtual table that does not physically exist. Rather, it is created by a query joining one or more tables.
2) 

CREATE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;

DROP VIEW view_name;

CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT new_column1, new_column2, ...
FROM new_table_name
WHERE new_condition;

3) Views in Oracle are created at the schema level, just like tables. 
4) Views in Oracle are virtual representations of data from underlying tables. They do not store data themselves.They present the most up-to-date information from the tables they are based on. 
5) Views make queries faster to write, but they don't improve the underlying query performance
